# üí´ About Me:
Hello! My name is Sergey Yaushev, and I am actively growing in the field of testing and automation. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in test automation using Python, pytest, and Playwright. I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing processes, and creating reliable tests that help improve product quality.

In addition, I develop custom websites and solutions that address unique challenges and enhance user experience. I also build Telegram bots, which helps me improve my programming skills and work with modern technologies.

One of my passions is creating educational content. I design courses and testing environments to train manual testers, helping them master new tools and approaches in testing.

Currently, I am looking for a job as a Python QA Automation Engineer. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to exciting projects, learn new things, and contribute to team growth. If you're interested in my resume or the projects I've worked on‚Äîwelcome to my GitHub! I‚Äôd be happy to collaborate and take on new challenges!

Let me know if you'd like any refinements! üòä
